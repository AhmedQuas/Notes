# Chapter 4: WLAN Configuration

SRWE - Switching, Routing and Wireless Essentials Bridging Concept

## 4.1 Remote Site WLAN Configuration

Basic network setup includes the following steps:
1. Log in to the router from a web browser.
2. Change the default administrative password.
3. Log in with the new administrative password.
4. Change the default DHCP IPv4 addresses.
5. Renew the IP address.
6. Log in to the router with the new IP address.

Basic wireless setup:
1. View the WLAN defaults.
2. Change the network mode.
3. Configure the SSID.
4. Configure the channel.
5. Configure the security mode.
6. Configure the passphrase.

`SSID` - Service Set Identified

`WMN` -  Wireless Mesh Netowrk

## 4.2 WLC Topology

>The access point (AP) is a controller-based AP as opposed to an autonomous AP. Recall that controller-based APs require no initial configuration and are often called lightweight APs (LAPs). LAPs use the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP) to communicate with a WLAN controller (WLC). Controller-based APs are useful in situations where many APs are required in the network. As more APs are added, each AP is automatically configured and managed by the WLC. 

Basic WLAN configuration on the WLC includes the following steps:
1. Create the WLAN.
2. Apply and Enable the WLAN.
3. Select the Interface.
4. Secure the WLAN.
5. Verify the WLAN is Operational.
6. Monitor the WLAN.
7. View Wireless Client Information.

## 4.3 Troubleshooting approaches

Troubleshooting steps:
1. Identify the problem.
2. Establish a theory of probable causes.
3. Test the theory to determine cause.
4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution.
5. Verify full system functionality and implement preventive measures.
6. Document findings, actions and outcomes
