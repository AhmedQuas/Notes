# Chapter 3: Protecting Your Data and Privacy

## 3.1 Protecting your data

Steps you can take to protect your devices from intrusions:
- keep firewall on and up to date
- use antivirus and antispyware
- download software from trusted places
- update OS, web browser and other applications regulary
- protect all devices - password protected to prevent unauthorized access, all data should be encrypted
- use encryption
- backup your data

>For mobile devices, `only store necessary information`, in case these devices are stolen or lost when you are away from your home. If any one of `your devices is compromised, the criminals may have access to all your data` through your cloud-storage service provider, such as iCloud or Google drive.

>IoT devices pose an `even greater risk` than your other computing devices, most of the IoT devices still `have their original firmware`.

Network protection:
- change default credentials
- change default administration panel
- use strong encryption, WPA2 or newer
- update routers and other network devices
- set strong password
- use VPN when you are using public network
- properly delete data permanently

>Use unique passwords for each online account. It is recomended to use password managers. It is also good idea to `use passphrase rather than password`.

Good password:
- Do not use dictionary words or names in any languages
- Do not use common misspellings of dictionary words
- Do not use computer names or account names
- If possible use special characters, such as ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( )
- Use a password with ten or more characters

>`Encryption` is the process of converting the information into a form where an unauthorized party cannot read it. Only a trusted, authorized person with the secret key or password can decrypt the data and access it in its original form. The encryption itself does not prevent someone from intercepting the data. Encryption can only prevent an unauthorized person from viewing or accessing the content.

>Encrypting File System (`EFS`) is a Windows feature that can encrypt data. EFS is directly linked to a specific user account. Only the user that encrypted the data will be able to access it after it has been encrypted using EFS.

## 3.2  Safeguarding your online privacy

`2FA` - Two Factor Authentication, in constant to traditional authentication in 2FA we use second token such as:
- physical object - phone, credit card, ATM card, fob(brelok)
- biometric scan - fingerprint, palm print, facial and voice recognition

`OAuth 2.0` - Open Authorization is a open standard protocol that allows an end user\`s credentials to access third party applications without exposing the user\`s password. OAuth acts as the middle man to decide whether to allow end users access to third party applications.

Tips:
- use 2FA if it is possible
- use password managers and rather passphrase than password
- do not share too much on social media
- email and web browsing privacy

>Security questions like “What is your mother’s maiden name?” or “In what city were you born?” are supposed to help keep your account safe from intruders. However, anyone who wants to access your accounts can search for the answers on the Internet. `You can answer these questions with false information, as long as you can remember the false answers`. If you have a problem remembering them, you can use password manager to manage them for you.
