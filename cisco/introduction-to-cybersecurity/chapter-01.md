# Chapter 1: The Need for Cybersecurity

## 1.1 Personal Data

`Cybersecurity` is the ongoing effort to protect these networked systems and all of the data from unauthorized use or harm. On a personal level, you need to safeguard your identity, your data, and your computing devices. At the corporate level, it is everyone’s responsibility to protect the organization’s reputation, data, and customers

`Personal information` that can uniquely identify you as an individual:
- pictures and massages that you exchange
- name, surname
- social security number
- data and place of birth
- mother\`s maiden name

This piece of information is known by you to identify you.

Types of personal data:
- `your identity`
- education data
- financial data, tax records, credit rating, credit card statement
- data on personal computing devices
- medical data, `EHR` - Electronic Health Records
- employment
- information online

Where data is stored and who have access to it?

>Besides allowing you to access your information, the computing devices can also generate information about you.

## 1.2 Organizational Data

Types of organizational data:
- `traditional data` - trademarks, patents, new products, plans, payroll, employee agreements
- `IoT and Big Data`

CIA triad:
- `confidentiality` - ensures the privacy of data by restricting access through authentication(2FA) and encryption
- `integrity` - ensures that the information is accurate and trustworthy. Checksum hashing can be used to check integrity of information eg: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512.
- `availability` - ensures that the information is accessible to authorized people. It can be obtained by creating backups, keeping OS up to date, maintaining equipment, disaster recovery plans, use security software like firewalls and try to avoid DoS and DDoS attacks.

>A hash function uses a mathematical algorithm to transform the data into `fixed-length` value that represents the data. The hashed value is simply there for comparison. From the hashed value, the original data cannot be retrieved directly.

>To protect an organization from every possible cyberattack is not feasible, for a few reasons. `The priority` will then be how quickly your security team can respond to the attack to minimize the loss of data, downtime, and revenue.

>`Many people reuse their passwords on different websites and accounts.`

## 1.3 Attackers and cybersecurity professionals

Types of attackers:
- Amateurs, `Script Kiddies`
- `Hackers`
  - `white hat` - break into networks or computer systems to discover weaknesses so that the security of these systems can be improved. These break-ins are done with prior permission and any results are reported back to the owner.
  - `grey hat` - take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain.
  - `black hat` -  may find a vulnerability in a system. Gray hat hackers may report the vulnerability to the owners of the system if that action coincides with their agenda. Some gray hat hackers publish the facts about the vulnerability on the Internet so that other attackers can exploit it. Gray hat attackers are somewhere between white and black hat attackers.
- `Organized hackers` - include organizations of cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists, and state-sponsored hackers.

Internal Security Threats:
- Mishandle confidential data
- Threaten the operations of internal servers or network infrastructure devices
- Facilitate outside attacks by connecting infected USB media into the corporate computer system
- Accidentally invite malware onto the network through malicious email or websites

>Internal threats also have the potential to cause greater damage than external threats, because internal users have direct access to the building and its infrastructure devices.

External Security Threats - can exploit vulnerabilities in network or computing devices, or use social engineering to gain access.

>`Cyberspace` has become another important dimension of warfare, where nations can carry out conflicts without the clashes of traditional troops and machines. This allows countries with minimal military presence to be as strong as other nations in cyberspace. `Cyberwarfare` is an Internet-based conflict that involves the penetration of computer systems and networks of other nations.
