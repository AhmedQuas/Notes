`Flowchart` - diagrams that are used to represent processes or workflows. It should be easy to understand without having to be an expert in the chosen field. It is a common way to represent an algorithm, it shows input states, decision states and the results of these decisions.
Elemets in flowchart:
- process
- data
- prefefined process
- termination
- decision
- preparation
- display
- off page connector
- connector

`Blocky` - visual programming tool created to help beginners to understand concepts of programming, by using blocks it allows a user to create a program without entering any lines of code. y for sensors and actuators. Blockly can be used to translate the block-based code into Python or JavaScript. 

`Prototyping` - process of creating a rudimentary working model of a product or system. It is technology demonstration, it is working verion of product and it is fully functional.

>In the IoT, it helps to have design skills, electrical skills, physical/mechanical skills, programming skills, and to understand how TCP/IP works. But you do not need to be an expert in any of these areas. In fact, prototyping helps you to refine these skills.

Electronic toolkits:
- Arduino
- Raspberry Pi
- Beagleboard
