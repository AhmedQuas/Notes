# Chapter 4: Everything can be automated

`Automation` -  any process that is self-driven and reduces, then eventually eliminates, the need for human intervention.

>Highly repetitive tasks such as automobile assembly were turned over to machines and the modern assembly line was born. Machines are excellent at repeating the same task without fatigue and without the errors that humans are prone to make in such jobs. This results in greater output, because machines can work 24 hours a day without breaks.

>Automation is often tied to the field of robotics. Robots are used in dangerous conditions such as mining, firefighting, and cleaning up industrial accidents, reducing the risk to humans. They are also used in such tasks as automated assembly lines.

Examples of using automation:
- smart home
- smart buildings
- `IIoT` - industial IoT, industry 4.0 and smart factories
- smart cities
- smart grids
- `ADS` - Automated Driving Systems smart car technology
- stores and services
- medical diagnosis and surgery
- aircraft auto-pilot

>Thinking - one possible definition is the ability to connect a series of related pieces of information together, and then use them to alter a course of action.

>Many devices that we interact with now have the word smart in their names. This indicates that the device has the ability to alter its behavior depending on its environment.

`AI` - Artificial Intelligence, uses intelligent agents that can perceive their environment and make decisions that maximize the probability of obtaining a specific goal or objective

`ML` - Machine Learning, subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to “learn” from their environment. This enables computers to improve on a particular task without being specifically programmed for that task. It is the ability to perform accurately on new, previously unseen tasks after gaining experience with a learning data set. The training data set must come from data that is representative of the larger data pool.

ML in IoT:
- speech recognition
- product recomendation
- shape recognition
- credit cash fraud detecion
- facial recognition

>`IBN` - Intent-Based Networking, uses AI and ML to ensure that any services that are deployed meet the required service level. If they do not meet the service level, the intent-based network can make alerts and provide suggestions for improvement. In some cases, the intent-based network can automatically reconfigure the network to comply with the service levels.

IBN consist of given elements:
- assurance
- translation
- activation

>Intent-based networking allows the company to focus on business goals. It provides an automated system that understands what the organization needs and then makes it happen.
