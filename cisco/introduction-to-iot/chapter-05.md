# Chapter 5: Everything needs to be secured

`PII` - Personal Identifiable Information 

`SPI` - Sensitive Personal Information

Types of data:
- Sensitive, PII
  - social security number
  - email adress
  - credit rating
  - fingerprints
  - birth date
  - credentials - username/password
  - home address
  - `VIN` - Vehicle Identification Number
- Informational
  - next train per station
  - average crops per province, gas consumption

Out data wants:
- good guys - legitime companies that have agreement(`Terms and Conditions or Terms of Service`) in place that gives them permission to use collected data
- bad guys - black hat hackers that want to sell, modify, damage, information

Security best practises:
- perform risk assessment
- create a security policy
- physical security measures
- HR security measures
- perform test and backups
- maintain security patches and updates
- employ access control
- regularly test incident response
- implement network monitoring, analytics and management tool
- implement network security devices
- encrypt data
- educate users
- implement comprehensive endpoint security solutions - antivirus and/or antimalvare

Physical security - it protects people, equipment and access to premises(rooms), it can be devided into:
- outside perimeter security
- inside perimeter security

Examples of physical security:
- fences and gates
- continuous video surveillance
- electronic motion detection
- security breach alarm
- security traps
- biometric access and exit sensors
- gas-based fire suppression systems
- air conditioning(HVAC)
- UPS backups generators
- seismically-braced server racks
- on-premise security officers

Factors that impact network security in the IoT:
- increasing number of devices
- non-traditional location of devices - heating systems, refrigerator, city lamps or underground
- lack of upgradeability

Safe Wi-Fi usage:
- change the default administration password
- change the SSID - network Service Set Identifier
- do not advertise SSID
- create a guest wireless network
- enable build-in firewall
- configure the wireless router to use WPA2-AES encryption
- keep the wireless router firmware updated
- use MAC filtering
- disable your wireless router\`s remote management feature
- physiaclly secure the wireless router

General information about protecting devices:
- keep the firewall on
- manage your OS and web browser
- use antivirus and antispyware
- protect all your devices 

>Public of unsecure Wi-Fi hotspots safety rules:
>- Do not access or send any sensitive personal information over a public wireless network
>- Verify whether your computer is configured with file and media sharing, and that it requires user authentication with encryption.
>- Use encrypted virtual private network (`VPN`) tunnels and services. The VPN service provides you secure access to the Internet, with an encrypted connection between your computer and the VPN service provider’s VPN server. With an encrypted VPN tunnel, even if a data transmission is intercepted, it is not decipherable.
